This software is written for CS 456 - Computer Networking, Fall 2013, Assignment 1. 
It is totally written by me, Nagendra Boddula, 20344521.

How to compile:
This can be built only on linux environment with g++ compiler.
To build the program, just navigate to the directory and type 'make'.
It should create two programs named 'server' and 'client'.

How to run the programs:
In order to run the sofware, always launch server before client.
1. Server can be launched by just typing these commands.
	./server
	./server &		if you want to launch the process but continue executing more commands on terminal.

2. To launch client, it needs 3 parameters: the ipaddress of server, the server port, and a random string.
The following three examples provide the working syntax. By default, the server is launched on port 11234.
	./client localhost 11234 'I love computer networking!!'
	./client 127.0.0.1 11234 'I love computer networking!!'
	./client ipAddress serverPort 'string in single quotes'

Note: The string should be encapsulated in single quotes.

Which machines was the code written on?
The code was written on and tested by using ssh into linux.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca.

Compiler version info?
g++ compiler was used to build and link the programs. The version used was 4.4.5.
